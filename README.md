#### This repository contains the code of the following tasks:
 * Implementing VQE from scratch for Portfolio optimization. It involves creating a `QUBO` from scratch, defining ansatz, finding expectation values in different basis, using `Gradient Descent` to optimize the function. This has been done using `Pennylane` and `Qiskit`.

 * Finding an optimal portfolio from a set of NSE stocks (Indian stock market) using `prebuilt vqe`
